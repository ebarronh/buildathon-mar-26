## Why We Built Cleo

Sales training is broken. Most teams rely on static playbooks, occasional workshops, and ride-alongs that don't scale. New reps take months to ramp, and experienced reps rarely get the practice they need to stay sharp.

Cleo changes that. We're building an AI-powered training partner that gives every rep access to realistic practice scenarios, instant feedback, and personalized coaching — available anytime, anywhere.

## What Cleo Does

Cleo combines four core capabilities into a single training platform:

- **AI Training Models** — Custom models trained on your actual products, processes, and winning techniques
- **Interactive Simulations** — Realistic buyer conversations that adapt based on what your rep says
- **Intelligent Grading** — Automated assessment of technique, product knowledge, and communication skills
- **Real-Time AI Voice** — Voice-powered coaching sessions that feel like talking to a senior mentor

## The Buildathon

Cleo is being built as part of the March 2026 Buildathon. Our goal is to take this from concept to working prototype in just a few weeks — proving that AI can fundamentally improve how sales teams learn and grow.

## The Team

We're a small team of engineers and sales professionals who believe training should be continuous, personalized, and actually engaging. We've seen firsthand how much potential gets left on the table when reps don't have the right practice tools.
